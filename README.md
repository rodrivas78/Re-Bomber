This project is still under development, but in the current version it is already possible to test the controls and mechanics and thus have an idea of what this game will be.

Soon new challenges and levels will be added.


Your mission: 

 You must redirect bombs that are falling from the sky onto the enemy (tanks and other war machines that are on the ground).
 To do this, you must fly over the bombs and press and hold the Joystick button (or SPACEBAR) to capture them.
 
To drop the bomb, just release the button (or spacebar).

Controls:

JOYSTICK BUTTON (or SPACEBAR): capture and drop the bomb
UP: the plane go up
DOWN:  the plane go down
