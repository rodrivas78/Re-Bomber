Re-Bomber  
a game for Atari 2600 by Rodrigo Gonzales

This is a project that is still under development, but in the current version it is already possible to test the controls and mechanics and thus have a good idea of what this game will be.

Soon new challenges and levels will be added.


Your mission: 

 You must redirect bombs that are falling from the sky onto the enemy (tanks and other war machines that are on the ground).
 To do this, you must fly over the bombs and press (and hold) the SPACEBAR to capture them.
 
To drop the bomb, just release the spacebar.

Controls:

SPACEBAR : caprture and drop the bomb
UP ARROW KEY: increase the plane's altitude
DOWN AROROW KEY:  decrease the plane's altitude
